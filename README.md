# Drum-Sounds
 This project is mainly used as an exercise for how you can manipulate the DOM and integrate sounds to a website.
  The functionality for this website are made in index.js file where firstly we make a variable to store the number of buttons, we query for all buttons from the class .drum and we add an event listener whick listens for click events on our function handleClick(). We add the sounds from the folder /sounds using the function makeSound with the 'key' parameter so we can use a shorter way to add them with switch method rather than if's and else if and we case every letter from our index.html file that stores the buttons so we can add the sounds on them. For an effect of animation I added and btnAnimation function with currentKey parameter that finds the button that has the current key to make flashes, we add a new class named pressed so we can add the flash functionality and then we use a setTimeout function that takes an anonymous function as a parameter and we delete the class pressed after 0.5 seconds. We call these functions into handleClick(), firstly the makeSound(buttonInnerHTML) to integrate the sounds that are stored into the keys w, a, s, d, j, k, l and after that we call the animation function.
